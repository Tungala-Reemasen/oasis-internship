                <h2>Career</h2>
                <h3 id="d">IPL Career</h3>
                <p>In the IPL, he played the first three seasons for the Delhi Daredevils. He then shifted base to the
                    Royal
                    Challengers Bangalore (RCB) in 2011. ABD will be again donning the RCB jersey in the 13th edition of
                    IPL, being organized in Dubai this time around due to the COVID-19 pandemic.In 154 IPL matches, he
                    has
                    scored 4395 runs at an average of 39.95 and a strike rate of 151.23. It includes 33 half-centuries
                    and
                    three centuries. His highest score of unbeaten 133 runs came against Mumbai Indians in 2015.</p>
                <h3 id="d">Text Career</h3>
                <p>After impressing the selectors during his short stint in the first-class arena, AB de Villiers was
                    drafted into the major league to play Test cricket. AB de Villiers made his Test debut along with
                    Dale
                    Steyn against England on 17 December 2004 at the age of 20.



                    ABD was quick to impress the cricket pundits as he stroked a well-crafted 52-runs inning in his
                    fourth
                    inning of Test career and saved South Africa from an imminent defeat. He also registered his first
                    Test
                    century in the series - a fluent 109 on his home ground in Centurion. In a matter of single series,
                    ABD
                    had shown that he belonged to this level.</p>
                <h3 id="d">ODI Career</h3>
                <p>AB made his ODI debut against England on 2 February 2005 at Bloemfontein. England batted first and
                    scored
                    270/5 in their 50 overs. South Africa too scored 270 for the loss of eight wickets and the match was
                    tied. AB scored 20 from 56 balls.



                    ABD made his maiden ODI hundred, 146 from just 130 balls including 5 sixes and 12 fours, in the
                    World
                    Cup Super 8 game against West Indies on 10 April 2007.</p>
                <h3 id="d">T20 Career</h3>
                <p>The face of innovation in modern-day cricket, AB's achievements in the limited-overs game are more
                    qualitative than quantitative.

                    His T20 debut came against Australia on 24 February 2006 at the Wanderers Stadium. De Villiers faced
                    only 3 balls for no runs and remained not out.



                    On 21 February 2016, against England, de Villiers scored the fastest T20I fifty by a South African,
                    in
                    just 21 balls. He completed the innings with 79 runs in 29 balls and led South Africa to a clean
                    sweep
                    in the T20I series</p>
                <h3 id="d">captaincy</h3>
                <p>Following South Africa's exit from the 2011 World Cup, de Villiers was named as the captain of their
                    ODI
                    and T20I team in June. Owing to the workload and pressure, he gave up the T20I captaincy in early
                    2013
                    but continued to play as South Africa's main batsman and their first choice wicket-keeper.



                    AB’s first international match as captain was an ODI against Sri Lanka on 11 January 2012 at Paarl.
                    South Africa posted 301/8 in their 50 overs. Sri Lanka were bowled out for a paltry 43 (their lowest
                    total in ODIs) in the 21st over and suffered their worst defeat in terms of runs.

                    He has captained South Africa in 103 ODIs and has won 59 of those. He led the Proteas in the ICC
                    Cricket
                    World Cup 2015 and they bagged a spot in the semis.



                    In Tests, AB has captained only for three matches and has won two and lost one. In the shortest
                    format,
                    he has captained for 18 matches and has won eight of them
